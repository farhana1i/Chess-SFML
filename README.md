# GUI-Based-Chess

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 square grid. Played by millions of people worldwide, you can play with your friend to spend your free time. It invokes the mind of a person to think differently and creatively. 

Under the concepts of object-oriented programming(OOP), I have tried to make it smooth and interactive by using C++ and SFML library. 

It includes several validations that are:

           * Valid moves of pieces
           * Check
           * Checkmate
           * Stalemate
           * Fool mate

# Instructions:
There are some instructions you need to follow. It includes:

            * Before running the game, you need to create an SFML project in Microsoft visual studio. Watch the following video to set up the 
              project: https://youtu.be/YfMQyOw1zik
            * After the setup, download the game's folder on your PC/laptop/computer.
            * After downloading, extract it. It will take a few seconds.
            * After extracting, go to the folder, where you downloaded repository, open src folder and copy all the files and paste them into the newly created project folder.
            * Now, open the visual studio, from the menu bar(on top), click on project->add Existing item->select all .cpp and .h files.
            * Click open.
            * [NOTE: "images" folder must be in the same folder where all .cpp and .h files are placed.]
            * Press ctrl+F5(in my case) to execute the program.

Now, you can enjoy the game.
